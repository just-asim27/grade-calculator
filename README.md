# 🎓 Grade Calculator  

Have you ever wondered what grade you’re going to get in a particular course?  
I always do—I like to estimate my results before the official announcement. But doing it manually was a headache: keeping track of weightages, components, and formulas felt like a burden.  

That’s why I built a **Grade Calculator**.

## 📌 Features  
- Calculate your grade in any course based on the course outline.  
- Flexible grading: since grading is usually **relative to the class**, the calculator allows you to **set your own grade ranges** (e.g., A+ = 90–100, A = 85–89, A- = 80–84).  
- Dynamic structure:  
  - Add or remove **course components** (e.g., Assignments, Quizzes, Midterm, Final).  
  - Each component can contain multiple **items**, which can also be added or removed.  
  - Add or remove **grade categories** with custom ranges.  
- Super handy for friends who ask, *“Can you check if I passed?”*

## 🛠️ Usage  

1. Open the calculator: [grade-calculator.infinityfree.me](http://grade-calculator.infinityfree.me)  
2. Add course components (e.g., Assignments, Quizzes, Midterm, Final).  
3. For each component, add or remove items (e.g., Assignment 1, Assignment 2, Quiz 1, etc.) and enter your marks.  
4. Define or adjust grade ranges (e.g., A+, A, A-, B), adding or removing categories as needed.  
5. Click **Calculate** to instantly see your final percentage and estimated grade.

## 📝 Note  
This is **not a GPA/CGPA calculator**. It’s specifically designed for calculating your grade in a single course.  
Once you know your grade, you can use any GPA/CGPA calculator available online to compute your overall performance.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack  
- **HTML** – Structure of the application  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Handles dynamic addition/removal of components, items, and grades  
- **PHP** – Backend logic and calculations

## 🔮 Possible Future Improvements  
I may or may not work further on this project, but here are some potential ideas for improvement:  
- Auto-save inputs so you don’t have to re-enter data each time.  
- Ability to export results as **PDF or Excel**.  
- Automatic fallback to **predefined grading schemes** (A+, A, A−, etc.) so grades are assigned even if you don’t add them manually.  
- Integration with a **GPA/CGPA calculator** for full academic performance tracking.
